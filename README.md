This little pure-JS demo renders an interactive image of the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) on a webpage.

You may use the mouse scrollwheel to zoom in to observe the infinite fractal patterns along the edges of the shape - no matter how far you zoom in, there will always be more and more details observable.

Each additional level of zoom will take longer and longer to update until it takes quite a long time to do so. 
This is a natural consequence of the fact that with each level of zoom, more iterations are required until the details of the boundaries can manifest.
That and the fact that this is literally running in a browser.

Additionally, there are limits to floating point precision and the number of iterations I'm willing to allow you to force your browser to do, and you'll notice the boundaries eventually get a little blurry.
